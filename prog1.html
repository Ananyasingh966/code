    <p>The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. 
        Also called the domestic dog, it was domesticated from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene,
         over 14,000 years ago by hunter-gatherers, prior to the development of agriculture. The dog was the first species 
         to be domesticated by humans. Experts estimate that due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded
          to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be
           inadequate for other canids.[4]</p>
